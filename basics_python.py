''' Here , we will solve some basic python problems
 Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers'''
# the result = sum if product <1000 else result = product
# all will be put in functions to control the execution

    print (f'result of {x1} + {x2} = {result}') # f in print do the formatting of variables values not names
# sum_product()

''' Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number'''
# Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

def iterate_sum():

'''Exercise 3 :Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number'''

# text_even_char() # if you print a function with no return, you will print None (that what all functions return by default)

'''Exercise 4 :Remove first n characters from a string'''
# Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.

'''Exercise 7: Return the count of a given substring from a string'''
# Write a program to find how many times substring “Emma” appears in the given string. (should work with any substring)
# print (dir(str)) # this will show all the str methods
